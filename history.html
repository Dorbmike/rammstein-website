                Rammstein are one of rock’s most individual and successful names, a multiple award-winning outfit with a vision that continues to evolve. Since forming in 1994, the six East Berliners have headlined the world’s major festivals and stadiums, selling millions of albums, and topping charts worldwide.

                    For the Rammstein kollektiv, and it’s the same line-up now as at the start, it’s always been a case of marching to their own beat; they sing in German, side-step those visuals typical of the metal world, and present an incendiary live experience that touches all of the senses – an experience underpinned by cultural and artistic weight. 
                    To date, there are seven studio albums under the Rammstein banner, the most recent being 2019’s untitled release – a body of work that headed the charts in 14 countries and went Top 10 in the US, breaking new ground. Produced by the band with Olsen Involtini, this 11-tracker (double platinum in Germany) was preceded by lead single ‘Deutschland’, a domestic No. 1 supported by a nine-minute movie – an epic, unflinching look at German history directed by Specter Berlin.

                    Not only was this album a decade in the making, it also saw the musicians taking their legendary live show into Stadiums, selling 800,000 tickets immediately and eventually playing to over 1.2 million fans across 17 countries.

                    The next leg of the European Stadium Tour takes place in spring / summer 2021, with most venues sold out.

            <p>
                <p>
                    Rammstein was founded by guitarist <a href="https://www.rammsteinworld.com/en/rammstein/history">Richard Z. Kruspe</a>. In 1989, he escaped to West Berlin and started the band Orgasm Death Gimmicks. At that time, he was heavily influenced by American music, especially Kiss. After the Berlin Wall came down, he moved back home to Schwerin, where <a href="https://www.rammsteinworld.com/en/rammstein/members/till-lindemann">Till Lindemann</a> worked as a basket-weaver, played drums in the band First Arsch.

                    At this time, <a href="https://www.rammsteinworld.com/en/rammstein/members/richard-zven-kruspe">Richard</a> lived with <a href="https://www.rammsteinworld.com/en/rammstein/members/oliver-ollie-riedel">Oliver Riedel</a>, of the band The Inchtabokatables, and <a href="https://www.rammsteinworld.com/en/rammstein/members/christoph-doom-schneider">Christoph "Doom" Schneider</a> (of Die Firma). Richard realized that the music he had previously created did not properly suit him; He envisioned something that would combine machines and the sound of heavy guitars. The three started working together on a new project. Richard soon found it extremely difficult to write both music and lyrics at the same time, so he talked <a href="https://www.rammsteinworld.com/en/rammstein/members/till-lindemann">Lindemann</a> into joining Rammstein. Richard first discovered Till when he overheard him singing while he was working.

                    A contest was held in Berlin for amateur bands in 1994, the winner of which would receive the opportunity to record a four-track demo audiotape in a professional studio. <a href="https://www.rammsteinworld.com/en/rammstein/members/richard-zven-kruspe">Kruspe</a>, <a href="https://www.rammsteinworld.com/en/rammstein/members/christoph-doom-schneider">Schneider</a>, <a href="https://www.rammsteinworld.com/en/rammstein/members/oliver-ollie-riedel">Riedel</a> and <a href="https://www.rammsteinworld.com/en/rammstein/members/till-lindemann">Lindemann</a> entered and won the contest, which caught the attention of <a href="https://www.rammsteinworld.com/en/rammstein/members/paul-landers">Paul H. Landers</a>, who wanted in on the project upon hearing their demo. To complete their sound, Rammstein then attempted to recruit <a href="https://www.rammsteinworld.com/en/rammstein/members/christian-flake-lorenz">Christian "Flake" Lorenz</a>, who used to play with Landers in Feeling B. At first Lorenz was hesitant, but eventually agreed to join the band.

                <p>
                    Rammstein began to record their first studio album entitled <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6HlDm9fzYxk4vkkr3YEvSv">Herzeleid</a> in March 1995 with producer Jacob Hellner. They released their first single <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/73se54LukI1xEPE8XKsrWf">Du riechst so gut</a> on 17 August and later released the album on 24 September 1995. Later that same year, they toured with Clawfinger in Warsaw and Prague. Rammstein headlined a tour of their own through Germany from 2 December to 22 December consisting of 17 shows which helped to boost the band's popularity. They then went on several tours throughout early 1996, releasing their second single entitled <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1Te8sn4moaldEi9WSHQkeH">Seemann</a> on 8 January 1996.

                    On 27 March, Rammstein performed on MTV's Hanging Out in London; their first performance in the UK. Rammstein's first major boost in popularity outside Germany came when music director Trent Reznor chose two Rammstein songs, Heirate mich and Rammstein, for David Lynch's film Lost Highway. The soundtrack for the film was released in the US in the fall of 1996 and later throughout Europe in April 1997.

                    Rammstein then went on to tour through Germany, Austria and Switzerland from September to October 1996, performing an anniversary concert on 27 September called "100 years of Rammstein". Guests to the concert included Moby, Bobo and The Berlin Session Orchestra, Berlin director Gert Hof was responsible for the light show.
