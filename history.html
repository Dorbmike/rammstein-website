                Rammstein are one of rockâ€™s most individual and successful names, a multiple award-winning outfit with a vision that continues to evolve. Since forming in 1994, the six East Berliners have headlined the worldâ€™s major festivals and stadiums, selling millions of albums, and topping charts worldwide.

                    For the Rammstein kollektiv, and itâ€™s the same line-up now as at the start, itâ€™s always been a case of marching to their own beat; they sing in German, side-step those visuals typical of the metal world, and present an incendiary live experience that touches all of the senses â€“ an experience underpinned by cultural and artistic weight. 
                    To date, there are seven studio albums under the Rammstein banner, the most recent being 2019â€™s untitled release â€“ a body of work that headed the charts in 14 countries and went Top 10 in the US, breaking new ground. Produced by the band with Olsen Involtini, this 11-tracker (double platinum in Germany) was preceded by lead single â€˜Deutschlandâ€™, a domestic No. 1 supported by a nine-minute movie â€“ an epic, unflinching look at German history directed by Specter Berlin.

                    Not only was this album a decade in the making, it also saw the musicians taking their legendary live show into Stadiums, selling 800,000 tickets immediately and eventually playing to over 1.2 million fans across 17 countries.

                    The next leg of the European Stadium Tour takes place in spring / summer 2021, with most venues sold out.
